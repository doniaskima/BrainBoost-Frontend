An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development.</p>
<p>Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming.</p>
<p>The on-campus version of CS50x , CS50, is Harvard's largest course.</p>
<p>Students who earn a satisfactory score on 9 problem sets (i.e., programming assignments) and a final project are eligible for a certificate.</p>
<p>This is a self-paced courseâ€“you may take CS50x on your own schedule.</p>
